## Your Personal Streaming Platform

StreamHome bridges the gap between premium VOD streaming experiences and the freedom of self-hosting.

Powered by a high-performance ASGI Python backend and a modern React 19 frontend, StreamHome transforms a personal media collection into a complete streaming platform with intelligent TMDB cataloging, adaptive HLS playback, personalized recommendations, cloud storage integration, automated recovery, and a source-agnostic ingestion API.

Your media remains under your control. StreamHome can store it locally, synchronize it with Google Drive, preserve portable recovery metadata alongside your media files, and maintain automatic local and cloud database backups.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> StreamHome is currently available as an **early public alpha pre-release**.
>
> The platform is still under active development. Features, APIs, installation procedures, database migrations, and system requirements may change before the full public alpha release.
>
> Back up your StreamHome data before installing an update.

## Why StreamHome?

Most self-hosted media platforms begin after your media library has already been prepared.

StreamHome is designed to manage the complete VOD experience:

* ingesting media from compatible clients;
* processing video, audio, subtitles, and playback markers;
* retrieving localized metadata and artwork;
* organizing local and cloud storage;
* protecting and rebuilding catalog data;
* learning from profile-specific viewing behavior;
* recommending what to watch next;
* delivering secure and adaptive playback.

StreamHome is not intended to feel like a server administration panel. It is designed to feel like a complete streaming platform that happens to run entirely under your control.

## ✨ Core Features

### ☁️ Google Drive and Rclone Integration

Built-in Google Drive storage powered by Rclone and native Google OAuth.

StreamHome manages its own Rclone configuration and integrates cloud storage without disrupting the established local media directory structure.

### 🎨 Four Distinct Interface Themes

StreamHome includes four complete presentation systems:

* **Ember**
* **Aurora**
* **Cinema**
* **Gemini**

Each theme provides its own navigation, hero presentation, cards, details pages, visual language, and player styling rather than functioning as a simple color preset.

### 🧠 Personalized Recommendation Engine

A profile-scoped recommendation system uses viewing activity, watch time, explicit preferences, watchlist changes, selected search results, repeated viewing, early exits, exposure fatigue, availability, and catalog traits to generate personalized feeds.

Recommendations can also include clear reasons explaining why a title was selected.

### 🎬 Automated TMDB Cataloging

StreamHome automatically retrieves localized movie, series, and episode information, including:

* posters and backdrops;
* cast and crew;
* genres and production information;
* episode metadata;
* plot summaries;
* catalog and recovery records.

Artwork and portable recovery metadata are stored alongside the relevant media directories.

### 🌊 Adaptive HLS Streaming

A secure fMP4 HLS playback pipeline prepares media in four-second segments and generates a source-resolution-aware quality ladder from 1080p down to 240p when applicable.

Playback supports local and Google Drive media sources through the same unified experience.

### 🔌 Source-Agnostic Ingestion API

The extensible `/api/add-movie` endpoint accepts authorized HTTP media sources and supports:

* independent video and audio URLs;
* custom request headers;
* subtitles;
* language information;
* quality labels;
* movie, season, and episode information;
* intro, recap, credits, and preview markers.

Media can be submitted by any compatible MediaSender client.

Official browser integrations are available separately:

* [StreamHome Extension for Chrome](https://github.com/StreamHome/StreamHome-Extension-Chrome)
* [StreamHome Extension for Firefox](https://github.com/StreamHome/StreamHome-Extension-Firefox)

These integrations communicate with StreamHome through its public ingestion API and are not tightly coupled to the core platform.

### 🚀 Guided Web Setup

A protected `/setup` wizard guides users through:

* administrator account creation;
* TMDB configuration;
* ingestion credential generation;
* optional TOTP authentication;
* recovery-code generation;
* local storage selection;
* Google Drive authentication and folder selection;
* configuration validation.

StreamHome manages the underlying configuration without requiring users to manually configure Rclone through a terminal.

### 🔐 Authentication and Session Security

StreamHome includes:

* local account authentication;
* database-backed sessions;
* optional TOTP two-factor authentication;
* one-time recovery codes;
* session revocation;
* login protection and lockouts;
* recent reauthentication for sensitive actions;
* short-lived playback authorization tickets.

### 🗜️ Automated HEVC Optimization

An optional background optimization system converts supported media to HEVC/H.265 to reduce storage consumption.

Optimization is designed to run only while the system is idle and pause when active users require server resources, preventing background encoding from interfering with normal playback.

### 🛡️ Backup and Recovery Architecture

Portable metadata records stored alongside media files allow StreamHome to rebuild catalog information if the primary database is lost or corrupted.

The database can also be backed up automatically to:

* local storage;
* Google Drive.

The recovery architecture is designed to preserve media availability, catalog metadata, accounts, profiles, settings, and playback state.

### 📱 Installable Progressive Web App

StreamHome can be installed as a Progressive Web App on supported desktop and mobile browsers.

The PWA provides:

* an application-like standalone experience;
* home-screen installation;
* automatic synchronization with the server-delivered client;
* supported offline functionality;
* access without maintaining separate native mobile applications.

## ⚙️ How It Works

StreamHome handles ingestion, processing, cataloging, storage, cloud synchronization, recommendations, and playback preparation in the background.

### 1. 📥 Capture and Send

Select a video or audio source that you are authorized to access and use.

Send it to StreamHome through an official browser integration, a script, a CLI client, an automation tool, or any other compatible MediaSender implementation.

### 2. ⚡ Immediate Source Playback

When supported, StreamHome can begin playback from the submitted source while the server downloads and processes the media in the background.

### 3. 🔀 Seamless Source Handoff

After the locally managed media becomes available, StreamHome can transition playback from the incoming source while preserving the current playback position.

### 4. 🎬 Processing and Cataloging

FFmpeg and FFprobe inspect and process compatible video, audio, and subtitle tracks.

StreamHome then creates the final media structure, retrieves metadata and artwork, and updates its portable recovery records.

### 5. ☁️ Storage and Cloud Synchronization

Finalized media can remain in local storage or be synchronized with Google Drive through StreamHome’s application-managed Rclone configuration.

Cloud uploads are verified before local media is removed when that behavior is enabled.

### 6. 🍿 Personalized Playback

The completed title becomes available through the selected StreamHome theme with profile-specific:

* progress and resume state;
* watchlist state;
* personalized recommendations;
* audio tracks;
* subtitles;
* quality controls;
* playback speed;
* skip markers;
* completion tracking.

## 🖥️ Server Recommendations

StreamHome is designed to operate efficiently, but FFmpeg processing, adaptive playback preparation, cloud transfers, and optional HEVC optimization benefit from additional resources.

| **Local Storage**    | 20 GB for application data, metadata, cache, and temporary files | 50+ GB SSD, especially when using Google Drive media storage              |

Actual requirements depend on catalog size, source quality, concurrent playback sessions, cloud configuration, and active media-processing jobs.

Background HEVC optimization pauses when users require server resources and therefore should not normally reduce playback capacity.
