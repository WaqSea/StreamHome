# Active Context

## Current focus

The full-page themed profile editor and approved web-only motion rebuild are implemented. Profile editing now uses an authenticated, return-aware `/profiles/:profileId/edit` route with live Ember, Aurora, Cinema, or Gemini previews, allowlisted avatar presets, dirty-state protection, and protected deletion. Generated artwork paths are resolved through a shared cached probe before an image mounts, preventing repeated wrong-year 404 errors such as The Furious reporting 2026 while its physical folder is 2025. The server remains unchanged and is the source of truth for all media information.

## Current web architecture

- React routes are protected by hydrated auth and a query-aware profile guard that resolves `profile` against server profiles.
- API modules normalize the server's wire format into stable TypeScript models.
- The selected profile controls one of four canonical themes: Ember, Aurora, Cinema, or Gemini. Legacy, missing, and unknown values fall back to Ember; only explicit `cinema` selects Cinema.
- The authenticated application uses canonical query state such as `/?profile=1&view=series`; My List uses `view=watchlist`, and search, genres, details, seasons, playback, downloads, and admin sections remain deep-linkable.
- Shared catalog controller hooks own API behavior while a typed theme registry selects distinct Ember, Aurora, Cinema, and Gemini navigation, heroes, cards, details, and player presentation.
- Ember follows the Obsidian Frost reference with responsive glass-depth transitions, artwork drift, sharp glass, orange edge glow, scanlines, serif display type, and technical mono labels. Aurora, Cinema, and Gemini retain separate editorial, cinematic, and workspace billboard identities.
- A typed motion registry supplies semantic interaction, menu, dialog, view, billboard, artwork, list, and player-control timings with distinct Ember glass-depth, Aurora floating-blur, Cinema dissolve, and Gemini modular choreography.
- Query-backed dashboard content uses a 280ms directional exit and 520ms theme-specific entrance with coordinated scroll reset. Search, watchlist, episode, artwork, player, profile, and admin state changes animate locally instead of remounting the full page.
- Profile hover/focus uses an intent delay and crossfades the complete ambient background to the profile theme. Ember particles are frame-rate-independent, rise slowly, and all decorative backgrounds pause while hidden.
- Billboards track automatic/manual source and direction and transition over 1.05 seconds. Category arrows use an interruptible 760ms requestAnimationFrame controller with edge clamping and cancel on direct pointer, touch, or wheel input.
- Buttons preserve their existing colors on hover and use transform/shadow feedback. Reduced-motion mode uses short opacity fades and disables spatial motion and decorative animation.
- Movies and Series use rotating server-catalog billboards followed by per-genre horizontal rails. Rail controls are attached to the left/right edges and native horizontal scrollbars are hidden.
- The active-profile control opens Edit Profile, Switch Profile, and Sign Out actions. Its placement is surface-aware: the bottom Gemini desktop sidebar opens upward, while top and mobile navigation opens downward, with viewport-safe menu bounds. Every Edit Profile entry point opens the dedicated editor and preserves its exact originating URL for Save, Cancel, and deletion return behavior.
- The profile editor owns draft name, theme, and avatar state. Theme changes preview only inside the editor until Save; saving the active profile then synchronizes the global theme while preserving existing PIN fields. Unknown legacy avatar values render a deterministic allowlisted fallback, so arbitrary stored CSS is never applied.
- The shared profile control intentionally contains only the avatar and profile name; the former caret `<i>` decoration is removed in every theme.
- The supplied StreamHome neon mark is a production web brand asset at `web/public/logo.png`. A shared `BrandLogo` component renders it on login, profile selection, all four theme navigation systems, Gemini compact/mobile navigation, and the admin header; the same asset is the browser favicon.
- `MediaArtwork` accepts direct server media paths and absolute HTTP(S) URLs. Compact filenames resolve through one shared cached range probe across generated `/media/...` candidates, mount only the valid image, crossfade after decode, and never substitute bundled media.
- The player resolves its movie or episode from authenticated server APIs and refuses playback when no physical media URL exists.
- Admin exposes only implemented server capabilities: current-account TOTP, storage/HEVC settings, and read-only download events.

## Security and data boundaries

- No media metadata or media files are stored in the web source tree.
- The ingestion API token is not exposed by the web client.
- SMTP/email OTP is not referenced; authentication and admin reauthentication use local TOTP.
- Queue source URLs are neither typed for UI use nor rendered.

## Next step

TypeScript lint, all 51 frontend tests, the production build, and diff checks pass. Browser QA confirmed the authenticated editor route reaches its themed loading state, then safely returns to login when the local session is rejected; full authenticated interaction QA and the required database checker remain unavailable because the existing local Python environment cannot start the server without `sqlmodel`.
